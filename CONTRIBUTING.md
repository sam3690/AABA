# Contributing to AABA

Thanks for your interest in helping shape the Autonomous Business Administration Agent! This guide explains how to get started quickly and contribute effectively.

## Code of conduct

By participating, you agree to uphold our shared commitment to respectful collaboration. Be kind, be inclusive, and assume good intent.

## Development setup

1. **Clone and fork** the repository.
2. **Install dependencies**
   - Backend: `cd backend && uv sync`
   - Frontend: `cd frontend && npm install`
3. **Copy** the environment template: `cp .env.example .env`
4. **Run the stack** via Docker Compose (`cd infra && docker compose up`).

## Branching strategy

- Create feature branches from `main` using the pattern `feature/<topic>` or `fix/<topic>`.
- Keep commits focused. Squash locally if necessary before submitting a PR.

## Testing & quality gates

Before opening a pull request:

- `cd backend && uv run pytest`
- `uv run ruff check .`
- `uv run mypy app`
- `uv run black --check app`
- Frontend lint (optional for now): `npm run lint`
- Ensure `docker compose build` completes without errors.

## Pull request checklist

- Provide a clear description of the change and motivation.
- Update documentation, env templates, or config files when introducing new services or variables.
- Reference any relevant issues or discussions.
- Include screenshots or logs for UX and operations changes.

## Review process

Project maintainers will review PRs as quickly as possible. Expect feedback on clarity, tests, docs, and adherence to existing code structure. Iteration is welcomeâ€”keep the conversation friendly and constructive.

## Communication

- Use GitHub Issues for bugs and feature requests.
- Start a discussion (or use GitHub Discussions) for architectural proposals or exploratory ideas.

## Thank you!

Your contributions make this project better for everyone. ðŸ™Œ
